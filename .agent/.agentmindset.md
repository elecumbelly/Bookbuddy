# Bookbuddy Development Mindset

## Core Principles

### 1. Rule of Explicitness
- **Never assume, add, or change features without explicit request**
- Every feature must be clearly specified before implementation
- Simplicity and clarity are top priorities
- Every line of code must be understandable at a glance

### 2. Quality Standard
- Always "think hard" and write elegant code
- Prefer Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors) over Dispatch/Combine
- Use Swift Testing framework with macros for new tests
- Follow Apple's latest platform conventions and APIs

### 3. Apple Platform Focus
- Favor Swift, Objective-C, C, and C++ over alternatives
- Use official platform names: iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS
- Leverage native Apple frameworks and APIs when available
- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization
- **Modular architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Protocol-oriented design**: Where appropriate for flexibility
- **MVVM or similar patterns**: For complex views
- **SwiftUI-first approach**: Prefer SwiftUI over UIKit for new features

### Data Management
- **Core Data best practices**: Proper thread safety and performance
- **Swift Data consideration**: For new data models when appropriate
- **Proper error handling**: No silent failures or graceful fallbacks that hide issues
- **Migration strategies**: Plan for data model changes

### Testing Strategy
- **Swift Testing framework**: Use macros for new tests
- **Test-driven development**: For well-defined functions
- **Integration tests**: For Core Data operations
- **UI tests**: For critical user flows

## Non-Negotiables

1. **No silent failures** - Explicit error handling required
2. **No backwards compatibility at expense of stability** - Delete deprecated code
3. **Token efficiency** - Keep context focused and relevant
4. **Apple platform conventions** - Follow platform idioms and patterns
5. **Code review standards** - All implementations must meet quality bar

## Project-Specific Rules

### Bookbuddy App Rules
- **Book data integrity**: ISBN validation, proper metadata handling
- **Reading progress tracking**: Accurate page/chapter tracking
- **Offline-first design**: Core functionality works without network
- **Privacy-focused**: Minimal data collection, user control over data
- **Performance**: Smooth scrolling for large book collections

### Output Formats
- Always ask before making commits to source control
- Provide clear implementation summaries after major changes
- Document breaking changes and migration steps
- Include test coverage reports for new features

## Approval Requirements
- **Major architectural changes**: Require explicit approval
- **Data model changes**: Require migration planning discussion
- **Third-party dependencies**: Require justification and approval
- **UI/UX changes**: Should align with Apple HIG and app design system
