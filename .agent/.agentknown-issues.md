## üö® CRITICAL: Gesture Recognition Blocking

### Issue Summary
**UIImpactFeedbackGenerator blocks the main thread** on devices without haptic engine support, causing iOS gesture recognition system to timeout with `"System gesture gate timed out"` errors. This breaks **ALL** gesture recognition app-wide, not just the element that triggered it.

### Symptoms
- Button taps don't respond at all
- Document scanner crop handles become non-functional
- Console shows: `"<0x102631400> Gesture: System gesture gate timed out."`
- Other UI elements (Cancel button, etc.) may still work while specific gestures fail

### Root Cause
`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator.impactOccurred()` performs synchronous work on the main thread. On devices without haptic hardware (or with haptic disabled), this operation hangs, blocking gesture event processing.

### Affected Code
- **UpdateProgressView.swift** - `handleMicrophoneTap()` function
- Any button/gesture handler that might add haptic feedback in the future

### Solution
**DO NOT use UIImpactFeedbackGenerator anywhere in this codebase.**

If haptic feedback is absolutely necessary in the future:
1. Check device capability first with `UIDevice.current.supportsHaptics` (custom extension needed)
2. Dispatch to background queue
3. Add timeout safeguards
4. Test on devices without haptic support (iPad models, older iPhones)

### Version History
- **v0.5.2** - Bug introduced by adding haptic feedback to mic button
- **v0.5.3** - Bug fixed by removing haptic feedback entirely

### Code Location
See inline comments in:
- `Bookbuddy/UpdateProgressView.swift:248-255` (handleMicrophoneTap)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Audio Session Management

### Issue Summary
Aggressive `AVAudioSession.setActive(false)` calls interfere with camera/document scanner audio sessions, causing:
- Audio session conflicts between speech recognition and camera
- `FigCaptureSourceRemote` errors in console
- Gesture recognition failures (secondary effect)

### Root Cause
Calling `AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(false)` immediately after stopping speech recognition deactivates the shared audio session that the camera/document scanner needs. iOS audio session management is complex and should be left to the system when multiple audio sources are active.

### Affected Code
- **SpeechRecognitionManager.swift** - `stopListening()` function

### Solution
**DO NOT manually deactivate audio session in stopListening().**

Let iOS manage audio session lifecycle automatically. The system will deactivate when appropriate.

If audio session management becomes necessary:
1. Use `.setActive(false, options: .notifyOthersOnDeactivation)` to be polite
2. Only deactivate when absolutely necessary (app backgrounding, etc.)
3. Test with camera-based features after changes

### Version History
- **v0.5.2** - Bug introduced by adding audio session cleanup
- **v0.5.3** - Bug fixed by removing audio session deactivation

### Code Location
See inline comments in:
- `Bookbuddy/SpeechRecognitionManager.swift:125-129` (stopListening)

## üìã User Workflow Requirements

### Speech Recognition Auto-Start (REQUIRED)

**User Intent:** Hands-free operation is the PRIMARY use case, not secondary.

The microphone button is **NOT** the primary interaction method. It's a fallback for when speech recognition gets it wrong.

**Correct Behavior:**
1. User opens Update Progress view
2. Mic auto-starts immediately (if authorized)
3. User speaks page number
4. Mic auto-stops after recognition
5. Button is only used to manually stop/restart if recognition fails

**DO NOT REMOVE auto-start functionality** thinking it improves UX or responsiveness.

### Version History
- **v0.5.2** - Bug introduced by removing auto-start (over-optimization)
- **v0.5.3** - Bug fixed by restoring auto-start behavior

### Code Location
See inline comments in:
- `Bookbuddy/UpdateProgressView.swift:189-198` (.task block)

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Strategies

### 1. Inline Code Comments
All critical sections have **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL** or **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT** comments explaining WHY code is the way it is and what NOT to do.

### 2. This Document
Reference `.agent/.agentknown-issues.md` in inline comments to provide full context.

### 3. Version Control
Git commit messages document the full regression cycle (introduction ‚Üí discovery ‚Üí fix).

### 4. Testing Protocol
Before refactoring speech recognition or camera features:
1. Test on physical device (not simulator)
2. Test with speech recognition auto-start
3. Test mic button stop/restart functionality
4. Test document scanner crop handles
5. Verify no gesture timeout errors in console
